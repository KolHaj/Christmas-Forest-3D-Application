# Christmas Forest 3D

The application takes basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a Christmas forest effect in the three dimensional environment.
Using WebGL JavaScript API we can call and modify the specific parameters of different shapes, colors, and positions to create
a christmas forest type of effect.

## Getting Started

The project is built using JavaScript with HTML/CSS so using any IDE that supports JavaScript will work and can be used edit and to run in the desktop. 
For the application to work you will just need to open the "Christmas_Forest.html" in the your browser of choice.

### Prerequisites

JavaScript IDE
or, Visual Studio Code

### Installing

Clone the project into your folder, the main file is the "Christmas_Forest.html" so opening that in a browser with the other files will open
the page automatically and allow all the functionality to work.
